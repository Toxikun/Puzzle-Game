# Puzzle-Game
That is a puzzle game developed by me and 4 of my friends by using java and mysql. There are couple of game modes such as 3x3,4x4, image 3x3 and challenge mode.  In challange mode you can challange any other registered players and take their point.
You need to change sql parts to run the code according to yout sql database. The only database you need is a table that includes users and their scores.
